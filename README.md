# PERN_Stack_TODO_WebApp

Here is the complete code for PERN Stack TODO app made from scratch.
Basically, PERN stack consists of PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js. 
I have learnt how to combine these technologies to build a full-stack web application and I have shared the complete code in this repository.
Anyone who wants to learn PERN Stack may clone this git repo as the code is completely refined and understanable.

Happy Coding! 😍
